This is an ISOBL model with a shifted boundary condition adjustment. The case
has a 4 m resolution with a 400 * 400* 112 m domain. The 3eq. are impelemented
with a law-of-the-wall representation for C_d. Law-of-the-wall is applied to
both momentum and 3eq.

In order for the wall model to work you need to create a symbolic link from
MITgcm_source/pkg/ to the wall_model folder within code/

This configuration was tested using c65k.
